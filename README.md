# MyCorzApp

MyCorz is a marketplace app for students and private tutors. Students can find nearest tutors around their location, register and pick any available class that has been put by tutors themselves.
While tutors can set up their own class and schedule, also approve selected students who signed to the class. This application also supports chat feature between tutors and their own students.
